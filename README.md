Database Management Website
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This website was developed to help me learn the basics of database management.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Motivation
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This website satisfies the Final Project for Oregon State University's CS340 Intro to Databases course, taken Fall 2017.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Platforms/Languages/Tools Used
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I developed this website in Atom and using NodeJS on the Oregon State University school server command line - CentOS. This website utilitizes NodeJS, JavaScript, Handlebars, HTML, and CSS.
My database is in MySQL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
		
Requirements To Run Code
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Should you choose to actually run this code, make sure you have all node modules downloaded prior to running, as that folder was far too large to include in this github repo. You will also need to have a database manager website as my database was through an OSU resource to which I no longer have access.

Tech/framework used

Built with
  - Atom on MacOS
